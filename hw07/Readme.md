# ECE497 HW #7

# The main files are gpio_test.c, mmapTest.c and buttons_leds.py

# gpio_test.c uses the kernal to operate and copy GPIO

# mmapTest.c uses mmap to operate and copy GPIO 

# buttons_leds.py uses interrupts to operate and copy GPIO

# The timing results of each GPIO method can be found in GPIO_Report.doc
