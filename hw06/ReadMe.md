# displayBoris.sh and etch-a-sketch.c are the main files 

# Before running either script, both install and install.sh need to be run as su

# To turn on the screen, run on.sh as su, off.sh has similar function

# displayBoris.sh displays a picture on a attached lcd screen

# etch-a-sketch.c uses 2 encoders to control an etch-a-sketch game, it must be run as su

# The color cycles automatically, but a starting point can be set via command line
# Ex: sudo ./etch-a-sketch.c 0 17 0 #r g b

# The size can be controlled with the MODE and PAUSE buttons

// Comments from Prof. Yoder
// What's the difference between install and install.sh?
// It works!
