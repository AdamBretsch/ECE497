The two main files for this assignment are etch_buttons.py and buttons_leds.py.

buttons_leds.py is a simple implementation of mapping GPIO input buttons to leds. It follows the template of the example, but for 4 buttons and leds.

etch_buttons.py uses a basic print of an array to implent a basic etch a sketch program. The 4 buttons on port GP0 can be used to move up, down, left and right. I had trouble implenting the buttons instead of keypresses, so it is currently stripped down to minimal features. I plan to reimplement other features, as shown by the TODOs in the code.

# Comments from Prof. Yoder
# Looks good.  TODOs appear to be missing, did you do them all?
