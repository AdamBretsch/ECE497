Etch_a_sketch.py can be run on the default BeagleBone image. No extra installs are required.

To use the program, run etch_a_sketch.py as an executable from the terminal.

A custom grid can be provided as command line arguments after typing the name of the file.
For example the commade ./etch_a_sketch.py 50 60 makes a 50 by 60 grid.
If no custom grid is provided, a 8 by 8 grid is chosen by default.

To control the cursor, use the arrow keys. Pressing z clears the screen, and pressing q quits the program

An intended feature that is not quite implemented yet is the ability to sketch with more characters than just X.
