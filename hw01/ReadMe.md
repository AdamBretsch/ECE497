Etch_a_sketch.py can be run on the default BeagleBone image. No extra installs are required.

To use the program, run etch_a_sketch.py as an executable from the terminal.

A custom grid can be provided as command line arguments after typing the name of the file.
For example the command ' ./etch_a_sketch.py 50 60 ' makes a 50 by 60 grid.
If no custom grid is provided, a 8 by 8 grid is chosen by default.

To control the cursor, use the arrow keys. Pressing z clears the screen, and pressing q quits the program.

To change the cursor, press any other key while not moving.
Some interesting keys to try: Space, Enter, |, #, Insert
